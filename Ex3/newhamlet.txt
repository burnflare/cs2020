WITH MARTIALL STALKE, HATH HE GONE BY OUR WATCH

BUT IN THE GROSSE AND SCOPE OF MY OPINION,
THIS BOADES SOME STRANGE ERRUPTION TO OUR STATE

   MAR. GOOD NOW SIT DOWNE, & TELL ME HE THAT KNOWES
WHY THIS SAME STRICT AND MOST OBSERUANT WATCH,
SO NIGHTLY TOYLES THE SUBIECT OF THE LAND,
AND WHY SUCH DAYLY CAST OF BRAZON CANNON
AND FORRAIGNE MART FOR IMPLEMENTS OF WARRE:
WHY SUCH IMPRESSE OF SHIP-WRIGHTS, WHOSE SORE TASKE
DO'S NOT DIUIDE THE SUNDAY FROM THE WEEKE,
WHAT MIGHT BE TOWARD, THAT THIS SWEATY HAST
DOTH MAKE THE NIGHT IOYNT-LABOURER WITH THE DAY:
WHO IS'T THAT CAN INFORME ME?
  HOR. THAT CAN I,
AT LEAST THE WHISPER GOES SO: OUR LAST KING,
WHOSE IMAGE EUEN BUT NOW APPEAR'D TO VS,
WAS (AS YOU KNOW) BY FORTINBRAS OF NORWAY,
(THERETO PRICK'D ON BY A MOST EMULATE PRIDE)
DAR'D TO THE COMBATE. IN WHICH, OUR VALIANT HAMLET,
(FOR SO THIS SIDE OF OUR KNOWNE WORLD ESTEEM'D HIM)
DID SLAY THIS FORTINBRAS: WHO BY A SEAL'D COMPACT,
WELL RATIFIED BY LAW, AND HERALDRIE,
DID FORFEITE (WITH HIS LIFE) ALL THOSE HIS LANDS
WHICH HE STOOD SEIZ'D ON, TO THE CONQUEROR:
AGAINST THE WHICH, A MOITY COMPETENT
WAS GAGED BY OUR KING: WHICH HAD RETURN'D
TO THE INHERITANCE OF FORTINBRAS,
HAD HE BIN VANQUISHER, AS BY THE SAME COU'NANT
AND CARRIAGE OF THE ARTICLE DESIGNE,

HATH IN THE SKIRTS OF NORWAY, HEERE AND THERE,
SHARK'D VP A LIST OF LANDLESSE RESOLUTES,
FOR FOODE AND DIET, TO SOME ENTERPRIZE
THAT HATH A STOMACKE IN'T: WHICH IS NO OTHER

BUT TO RECOUER OF VS BY STRONG HAND
AND TERMES COMPULSATIUE, THOSE FORESAID LANDS
SO BY HIS FATHER LOST: AND THIS (I TAKE IT)

THE SOURSE OF THIS OUR WATCH, AND THE CHEEFE HEAD
OF THIS POST-HAST, AND ROMAGE IN THE LAND.
ENTER GHOST AGAINE.

THAT MAY TO THEE DO EASE, AND GRACE TO ME; SPEAK TO ME.
IF THOU ART PRIUY TO THY COUNTRIES FATE
(WHICH HAPPILY FOREKNOWING MAY AUOYD) OH SPEAKE.
OR, IF THOU HAST VP-HOORDED IN THY LIFE
EXTORTED TREASURE IN THE WOMBE OF EARTH,
(FOR WHICH, THEY SAY, YOU SPIRITS OFT WALKE IN DEATH)
SPEAKE OF IT. STAY, AND SPEAKE. STOP IT MARCELLUS

  HOR. DO, IF IT WILL NOT STAND

   BARN. 'TIS HEERE

WE DO IT WRONG, BEING SO MAIESTICALL
TO OFFER IT THE SHEW OF VIOLENCE,

THIS PRESENT OBIECT MADE PROBATION

   MAR. IT FADED ON THE CROWING OF THE COCKE.
SOME SAYES, THAT EUER 'GAINST THAT SEASON COMES
WHEREIN OUR SAUIOURS BIRCH IS CELEBRATED,
THE BIRD OF DAWNING SINGETH ALL NIGHT LONG:
AND THEN (THEY SAY) NO SPIRIT CAN WALKE ABROAD,
THE NIGHTS ARE WHOLSOME, THEN NO PLANETS STRIKE,
NO FAIERY TALKES, NOR WITCH HATH POWER TO CHARME:
SO HALLOW'D, AND SO GRACIOUS IS THE TIME

   HOR. SO HAUE I HEARD, AND DO IN PART BELEEUE IT.
BUT LOOKE, THE MORNE IN RUSSET MANTLE CLAD,
WALKES O'RE THE DEW OF YON HIGH EASTERNE HILL,
BREAKE WE OUR WATCH VP, AND BY MY ADUICE
LET VS IMPART WHAT WE HAUE SEENE TO NIGHT
VNTO YONG HAMLET. FOR VPON MY LIFE,
THIS SPIRIT DUMBE TO VS, WILL SPEAKE TO HIM:
DO YOU CONSENT WE SHALL ACQUAINT HIM WITH IT,
AS NEEDFULL IN OUR LOUES, FITTING OUR DUTY?
  MAR. LET DO'T I PRAY, AND I THIS MORNING KNOW
WHERE WE SHALL FINDE HIM MOST CONUENIENTLY.

YOU CANNOT SPEAKE OF REASON TO THE DANE,

THAT SHALL NOT BE MY OFFER, NOT THY ASKING?
THE HEAD IS NOT MORE NATIUE TO THE HEART,
THE HAND MORE INSTRUMENTALL TO THE MOUTH,
THEN IS THE THRONE OF DENMARKE TO THY FATHER.
WHAT WOULD'ST THOU HAUE LAERTES?
  LAER. DREAD MY LORD,

   QUEEN. GOOD HAMLET CAST THY NIGHTLY COLOUR OFF,
AND LET THINE EYE LOOKE LIKE A FRIEND ON DENMARKE.
DO NOT FOR EUER WITH THY VEYLED LIDS
SEEKE FOR THY NOBLE FATHER IN THE DUST;
THOU KNOW'ST 'TIS COMMON, ALL THAT LIUES MUST DYE,
PASSING THROUGH NATURE, TO ETERNITY

   HAM. I MADAM, IT IS COMMON

   QUEEN. IF IT BE;
WHY SEEMES IT SO PARTICULAR WITH THEE

   HAM. SEEMES MADAM? NAY, IT IS: I KNOW NOT SEEMES:
'TIS NOT ALONE MY INKY CLOAKE (GOOD MOTHER)
NOR CUSTOMARY SUITES OF SOLEMNE BLACKE,
NOR WINDY SUSPIRATION OF FORC'D BREATH,
NO, NOR THE FRUITFULL RIUER IN THE EYE,
NOR THE DEIECTED HAUIOUR OF THE VISAGE,
TOGETHER WITH ALL FORMES, MOODS, SHEWES OF GRIEFE,
THAT CAN DENOTE ME TRULY. THESE INDEED SEEME,
FOR THEY ARE ACTIONS THAT A MAN MIGHT PLAY:
BUT I HAUE THAT WITHIN, WHICH PASSETH SHOW;
THESE, BUT THE TRAPPINGS, AND THE SUITES OF WOE

   KING. 'TIS SWEET AND COMMENDABLE
IN YOUR NATURE HAMLET,
TO GIUE THESE MOURNING DUTIES TO YOUR FATHER:
BUT YOU MUST KNOW, YOUR FATHER LOST A FATHER,
THAT FATHER LOST, LOST HIS, AND THE SURUIUER BOUND
IN FILIALL OBLIGATION, FOR SOME TERME
TO DO OBSEQUIOUS SORROW. BUT TO PERSEUER
IN OBSTINATE CONDOLEMENT, IS A COURSE
OF IMPIOUS STUBBORNNESSE. 'TIS VNMANLY GREEFE,
IT SHEWES A WILL MOST INCORRECT TO HEAUEN,
A HEART VNFORTIFIED, A MINDE IMPATIENT,
AN VNDERSTANDING SIMPLE, AND VNSCHOOL'D:
FOR, WHAT WE KNOW MUST BE, AND IS AS COMMON
AS ANY THE MOST VULGAR THING TO SENCE,
WHY SHOULD WE IN OUR PEEUISH OPPOSITION
TAKE IT TO HEART? FYE, 'TIS A FAULT TO HEAUEN,
A FAULT AGAINST THE DEAD, A FAULT TO NATURE,
TO REASON MOST ABSURD, WHOSE COMMON THEAME
IS DEATH OF FATHERS, AND WHO STILL HATH CRIED,
FROM THE FIRST COARSE, TILL HE THAT DYED TO DAY,
THIS MUST BE SO. WE PRAY YOU THROW TO EARTH
THIS VNPREUAYLING WOE, AND THINKE OF VS
AS OF A FATHER; FOR LET THE WORLD TAKE NOTE,
YOU ARE THE MOST IMMEDIATE TO OUR THRONE,
AND WITH NO LESSE NOBILITY OF LOUE,
THEN THAT WHICH DEEREST FATHER BEARES HIS SONNE,
DO I IMPART TOWARDS YOU. FOR YOUR INTENT
IN GOING BACKE TO SCHOOLE IN WITTENBERG,
IT IS MOST RETROGRADE TO OUR DESIRE:
AND WE BESEECH YOU, BEND YOU TO REMAINE
HEERE IN THE CHEERE AND COMFORT OF OUR EYE,
OUR CHEEFEST COURTIER COSIN, AND OUR SONNE

   QU. LET NOT THY MOTHER LOSE HER PRAYERS HAMLET:
I PRYTHEE STAY WITH VS, GO NOT TO WITTENBERG

   HAM. I SHALL IN ALL MY BEST
OBEY YOU MADAM

   KING. WHY 'TIS A LOUING, AND A FAIRE REPLY,
BE AS OUR SELFE IN DENMARKE. MADAM COME,
THIS GENTLE AND VNFORC'D ACCORD OF HAMLET
SITS SMILING TO MY HEART; IN GRACE WHEREOF,
NO IOCOND HEALTH THAT DENMARKE DRINKES TO DAY,
BUT THE GREAT CANNON TO THE CLOWDS SHALL TELL,
AND THE KINGS ROUCE, THE HEAUENS SHALL BRUITE AGAINE,
RESPEAKING EARTHLY THUNDER. COME AWAY.

EXEUNT.

HOW WEARY, STALE, FLAT, AND VNPROFITABLE
SEEMES TO ME ALL THE VSES OF THIS WORLD?
FIE ON'T? OH FIE, FIE, 'TIS AN VNWEEDED GARDEN
THAT GROWES TO SEED: THINGS RANK, AND GROSSE IN NATURE
POSSESSE IT MEERELY. THAT IT SHOULD COME TO THIS:
BUT TWO MONTHS DEAD: NAY, NOT SO MUCH; NOT TWO,
SO EXCELLENT A KING, THAT WAS TO THIS
HIPERION TO A SATYRE: SO LOUING TO MY MOTHER,
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BETEENE THE WINDES OF HEAUEN
VISIT HER FACE TOO ROUGHLY. HEAUEN AND EARTH
MUST I REMEMBER: WHY SHE WOULD HANG ON HIM,
AS IF ENCREASE OF APPETITE HAD GROWNE
BY WHAT IS FED ON; AND YET WITHIN A MONTH?
LET ME NOT THINKE ON'T: FRAILTY, THY NAME IS WOMAN.
A LITTLE MONTH, OR ERE THOSE SHOOES WERE OLD,
WITH WHICH SHE FOLLOWED MY POORE FATHERS BODY
LIKE NIOBE, ALL TEARES. WHY SHE, EUEN SHE.
(O HEAUEN! A BEAST THAT WANTS DISCOURSE OF REASON
WOULD HAUE MOURN'D LONGER) MARRIED WITH MINE VNKLE,
MY FATHERS BROTHER: BUT NO MORE LIKE MY FATHER,
THEN I TO HERCULES. WITHIN A MONETH?
ERE YET THE SALT OF MOST VNRIGHTEOUS TEARES
HAD LEFT THE FLUSHING OF HER GAULED EYES,
SHE MARRIED. O MOST WICKED SPEED, TO POST
WITH SUCH DEXTERITY TO INCESTUOUS SHEETS:
IT IS NOT, NOR IT CANNOT COME TO GOOD.
BUT BREAKE MY HEART, FOR I MUST HOLD MY TONGUE.

APPEARES BEFORE THEM, AND WITH SOLLEMNE MARCH
GOES SLOW AND STATELY: BY THEM THRICE HE WALKT,
BY THEIR OPPREST AND FEARE-SURPRIZED EYES,
WITHIN HIS TRUNCHEONS LENGTH; WHILST THEY BESTIL'D
ALMOST TO IELLY WITH THE ACT OF FEARE,
STAND DUMBE AND SPEAKE NOT TO HIM. THIS TO ME
IN DREADFULL SECRECIE IMPART THEY DID,
AND I WITH THEM THE THIRD NIGHT KEPT THE WATCH,
WHEREAS THEY HAD DELIUER'D BOTH IN TIME,

SCENA TERTIA


ENTER LAERTES AND OPHELIA.

BUT LET ME HEARE FROM YOU

   OPHEL. DOE YOU DOUBT THAT?
  LAER. FOR HAMLET, AND THE TRIFLING OF HIS FAUOURS,
HOLD IT A FASHION AND A TOY IN BLOUDE;
A VIOLET IN THE YOUTH OF PRIMY NATURE;
FROWARD, NOT PERMANENT; SWEET NOT LASTING
THE SUPPLIANCE OF A MINUTE? NO MORE

   OPHEL. NO MORE BUT SO

   LAER. THINKE IT NO MORE:
FOR NATURE CRESSANT DOES NOT GROW ALONE,
IN THEWES AND BULKE: BUT AS HIS TEMPLE WAXES,
THE INWARD SERUICE OF THE MINDE AND SOULE
GROWES WIDE WITHALL. PERHAPS HE LOUES YOU NOW,
AND NOW NO SOYLE NOR CAUTELL DOTH BESMERCH
THE VERTUE OF HIS FEARE: BUT YOU MUST FEARE
HIS GREATNESSE WEIGH'D, HIS WILL IS NOT HIS OWNE;
FOR HEE HIMSELFE IS SUBIECT TO HIS BIRTH:
HEE MAY NOT, AS VNUALLUED PERSONS DOE,
CARUE FOR HIMSELFE; FOR, ON HIS CHOYCE DEPENDS
THE SANCTITY AND HEALTH OF THE WHOLE STATE.
AND THEREFORE MUST HIS CHOYCE BE CIRCUMSCRIB'D
VNTO THE VOYCE AND YEELDING OF THAT BODY,
WHEREOF HE IS THE HEAD. THEN IF HE SAYES HE LOUES YOU,
IT FITS YOUR WISEDOME SO FARRE TO BELEEUE IT;
AS HE IN HIS PECULIAR SECT AND FORCE
MAY GIUE HIS SAYING DEED: WHICH IS NO FURTHER,
THEN THE MAINE VOYCE OF DENMARKE GOES WITHALL.
THEN WEIGHT WHAT LOSSE YOUR HONOUR MAY SUSTAINE,
IF WITH TOO CREDENT EARE YOU LIST HIS SONGS;
OR LOSE YOUR HEART; OR YOUR CHAST TREASURE OPEN
TO HIS VNMASTRED IMPORTUNITY.
FEARE IT OPHELIA, FEARE IT MY DEARE SISTER,
AND KEEPE WITHIN THE REARE OF YOUR AFFECTION;
OUT OF THE SHOT AND DANGER OF DESIRE.
THE CHARIEST MAID IS PRODIGALL ENOUGH,
IF SHE VNMASKE HER BEAUTY TO THE MOONE:
VERTUE IT SELFE SCAPES NOT CALUMNIOUS STROAKES,
THE CANKER GALLS, THE INFANTS OF THE SPRING
TOO OFT BEFORE THE BUTTONS BE DISCLOS'D,
AND IN THE MORNE AND LIQUID DEW OF YOUTH,
CONTAGIOUS BLASTMENTS ARE MOST IMMINENT.
BE WARY THEN, BEST SAFETY LIES IN FEARE;
YOUTH TO IT SELFE REBELS, THOUGH NONE ELSE NEERE

   OPHE. I SHALL TH' EFFECT OF THIS GOOD LESSON KEEPE,
AS WATCHMEN TO MY HEART: BUT GOOD MY BROTHER
DOE NOT AS SOME VNGRACIOUS PASTORS DOE,
SHEW ME THE STEEPE AND THORNY WAY TO HEAUEN;
WHILST LIKE A PUFT AND RECKLESSE LIBERTINE
HIMSELFE, THE PRIMROSE PATH OF DALLIANCE TREADS,
AND REAKS NOT HIS OWNE READE

   LAER. OH, FEARE ME NOT.
ENTER POLONIUS.

I STAY TOO LONG; BUT HERE MY FATHER COMES:
A DOUBLE BLESSING IS A DOUBLE GRACE;

THE WINDE SITS IN THE SHOULDER OF YOUR SAILE,
AND YOU ARE STAID FOR THERE: MY BLESSING WITH YOU;
AND THESE FEW PRECEPTS IN THY MEMORY,
SEE THOU CHARACTER. GIUE THY THOUGHTS NO TONGUE,
NOR ANY VNPROPORTION'D THOUGHTS HIS ACT:
BE THOU FAMILIAR; BUT BY NO MEANES VULGAR:
THE FRIENDS THOU HAST, AND THEIR ADOPTION TRIDE,
GRAPPLE THEM TO THY SOULE, WITH HOOPES OF STEELE:
BUT DOE NOT DULL THY PALME, WITH ENTERTAINMENT
OF EACH VNHATCH'T, VNFLEDG'D COMRADE. BEWARE
OF ENTRANCE TO A QUARRELL: BUT BEING IN
BEAR'T THAT TH' OPPOSED MAY BEWARE OF THEE.
GIUE EUERY MAN THINE EARE; BUT FEW THY VOYCE:
TAKE EACH MANS CENSURE; BUT RESERUE THY IUDGEMENT:
COSTLY THY HABIT AS THY PURSE CAN BUY;
BUT NOT EXPREST IN FANCIE; RICH, NOT GAWDIE:
FOR THE APPARELL OFT PROCLAIMES THE MAN.
AND THEY IN FRANCE OF THE BEST RANCK AND STATION,
ARE OF A MOST SELECT AND GENEROUS CHEFF IN THAT.
NEITHER A BORROWER, NOR A LENDER BE;
FOR LONE OFT LOSES BOTH IT SELFE AND FRIEND:
AND BORROWING DULS THE EDGE OF HUSBANDRY.
THIS ABOUE ALL; TO THINE OWNE SELFE BE TRUE:
AND IT MUST FOLLOW, AS THE NIGHT THE DAY,
THOU CANST NOT THEN BE FALSE TO ANY MAN.
FAREWELL: MY BLESSING SEASON THIS IN THEE

   LAER. MOST HUMBLY DOE I TAKE MY LEAUE, MY LORD

   POLON. THE TIME INUITES YOU, GOE, YOUR SERUANTS TEND

  OPHE. I DO NOT KNOW, MY LORD, WHAT I SHOULD THINKE

   POLON. MARRY ILE TEACH YOU; THINKE YOUR SELFE A BABY,

WHICH ARE NOT STARLING. TENDER YOUR SELFE MORE DEARLY;

BELEEUE SO MUCH IN HIM, THAT HE IS YOUNG,
AND WITH A LARGER TETHER MAY HE WALKE,
THEN MAY BE GIUEN YOU. IN FEW, OPHELIA,
DOE NOT BELEEUE HIS VOWES; FOR THEY ARE BROAKERS,
NOT OF THE EYE, WHICH THEIR INUESTMENTS SHOW:
BUT MEERE IMPLORATORS OF VNHOLY SUTES,
BREATHING LIKE SANCTIFIED AND PIOUS BONDS,
THE BETTER TO BEGUILE. THIS IS FOR ALL:
I WOULD NOT, IN PLAINE TEARMES, FROM THIS TIME FORTH,
HAUE YOU SO SLANDER ANY MOMENT LEISURE,
AS TO GIUE WORDS OR TALKE WITH THE LORD HAMLET:
LOOKE TOO'T, I CHARGE YOU; COME YOUR WAYES

AND THERE ASSUMES SOME OTHER HORRIBLE FORME,
WHICH MIGHT DEPRIUE YOUR SOUERAIGNTY OF REASON,

VPON A WRETCH, WHOSE NATURALL GIFTS WERE POORE

BUT SOFT, ME THINKES I SENT THE MORNINGS AYRE;
BRIEFE LET ME BE: SLEEPING WITHIN MINE ORCHARD,

VPON MY SECURE HOWER THY VNCLE STOLE
WITH IUYCE OF CURSED HEBENON IN A VIOLL,
AND IN THE PORCHES OF MINE EARES DID POURE

THE NATURALL GATES AND ALLIES OF THE BODY;
AND WITH A SODAINE VIGOUR IT DOTH POSSET
AND CURD, LIKE AYGRE DROPPINGS INTO MILKE,

BUT HOWSOEUER THOU PURSUEST THIS ACT,
TAINT NOT THY MIND; NOR LET THY SOULE CONTRIUE

IT SEEMES IT IS AS PROPER TO OUR AGE,
TO CAST BEYOND OUR SELUES IN OUR OPINIONS,
AS IT IS COMMON FOR THE YONGER SORT

THIS MUST BE KNOWNE, BEING KEPT CLOSE MIGHT MOUE

ON FORTINBRAS, WHICH HE (IN BREEFE) OBEYES,
RECEIUES REBUKE FROM NORWEY: AND IN FINE,
MAKES VOW BEFORE HIS VNKLE, NEUER MORE

WHEREON OLD NORWEY, OUERCOME WITH IOY,
GIUES HIM THREE THOUSAND CROWNES IN ANNUALL FEE,
AND HIS COMMISSION TO IMPLOY THOSE SOLDIERS
SO LEUIED AS BEFORE, AGAINST THE POLEAK:
WITH AN INTREATY HEEREIN FURTHER SHEWNE,

   POL. NOT I MY LORD

   HAM. THEN I WOULD YOU WERE SO HONEST A MAN

   POL. HONEST, MY LORD?
  HAM. I SIR, TO BE HONEST AS THIS WORLD GOES, IS TO BEE

   POL. THAT'S VERY TRUE, MY LORD

   HAM. FOR IF THE SUN BREED MAGOTS IN A DEAD DOGGE,
BEING A GOOD KISSING CARRION-
HAUE YOU A DAUGHTER?

   POL. HOW SAY YOU BY THAT? STILL HARPING ON MY DAUGHTER:
YET HE KNEW ME NOT AT FIRST; HE SAID I WAS A FISHMONGER:

   POL. THOUGH THIS BE MADNESSE,

I WILL LEAUE HIM,

GUILDENSTERNE? OH, ROSINCRANE; GOOD LADS: HOW DOE YE

  ROSIN. NONE MY LORD; BUT THAT THE WORLD'S GROWNE
HONEST

   HAM. THEN IS DOOMESDAY NEERE: BUT YOUR NEWES IS
NOT TRUE. LET ME QUESTION MORE IN PARTICULAR: WHAT HAUE
YOU MY GOOD FRIENDS, DESERUED AT THE HANDS OF FORTUNE,
THAT SHE SENDS YOU TO PRISON HITHER?
  GUIL. PRISON, MY LORD?
  HAM. DENMARK'S A PRISON

   ROSIN. THEN IS THE WORLD ONE

   HAM. A GOODLY ONE, IN WHICH THERE ARE MANY CONFINES,
WARDS, AND DUNGEONS; DENMARKE BEING ONE O'TH'
WORST

   ROSIN. WE THINKE NOT SO MY LORD

   HAM. WHY THEN 'TIS NONE TO YOU; FOR THERE IS NOTHING
EITHER GOOD OR BAD, BUT THINKING MAKES IT SO: TO ME IT IS
A PRISON

   ROSIN. WHY THEN YOUR AMBITION MAKES IT ONE: 'TIS
TOO NARROW FOR YOUR MINDE

   HAM. O GOD, I COULD BE BOUNDED IN A NUTSHELL, AND
COUNT MY SELFE A KING OF INFINITE SPACE; WERE IT NOT THAT
I HAUE BAD DREAMES

   GUIL. WHICH DREAMES INDEED ARE AMBITION: FOR THE
VERY SUBSTANCE OF THE AMBITIOUS, IS MEERELY THE SHADOW
OF A DREAME

   HAM. A DREAME IT SELFE IS BUT A SHADOW

   ROSIN. TRUELY, AND I HOLD AMBITION OF SO AYRY AND
LIGHT A QUALITY, THAT IT IS BUT A SHADOWES SHADOW

   HAM. THEN ARE OUR BEGGERS BODIES; AND OUR MONARCHS
AND OUT-STRETCHT HEROES THE BEGGERS SHADOWES:
SHALL WEE TO TH' COURT: FOR, BY MY FEY I CANNOT REASON?
  BOTH. WEE'L WAIT VPON YOU

   HAM. NO SUCH MATTER. I WILL NOT SORT YOU WITH THE
REST OF MY SERUANTS: FOR TO SPEAKE TO YOU LIKE AN HONEST
MAN: I AM MOST DREADFULLY ATTENDED; BUT IN THE BEATEN
WAY OF FRIENDSHIP, WHAT MAKE YOU AT ELSONOWER?
  ROSIN. TO VISIT YOU MY LORD, NO OTHER OCCASION

   HAM. BEGGER THAT I AM, I AM EUEN POORE IN THANKES;
BUT I THANKE YOU: AND SURE DEARE FRIENDS MY THANKS
ARE TOO DEARE A HALFEPENY; WERE YOU NOT SENT FOR? IS IT
YOUR OWNE INCLINING? IS IT A FREE VISITATION? COME,
DEALE IUSTLY WITH ME: COME, COME; NAY SPEAKE

   GUIL. WHAT SHOULD WE SAY MY LORD?
  HAM. WHY ANY THING. BUT TO THE PURPOSE; YOU WERE
SENT FOR; AND THERE IS A KINDE CONFESSION IN YOUR LOOKES;
WHICH YOUR MODESTIES HAUE NOT CRAFT ENOUGH TO COLOR,
I KNOW THE GOOD KING & QUEENE HAUE SENT FOR YOU

   ROSIN. TO WHAT END MY LORD?
  HAM. THAT YOU MUST TEACH ME: BUT LET MEE CONIURE
YOU BY THE RIGHTS OF OUR FELLOWSHIP, BY THE CONSONANCY OF
OUR YOUTH, BY THE OBLIGATION OF OUR EUER-PRESERUED LOUE,
AND BY WHAT MORE DEARE, A BETTER PROPOSER COULD CHARGE
YOU WITHALL; BE EUEN AND DIRECT WITH ME, WHETHER YOU
WERE SENT FOR OR NO

   ROSIN. WHAT SAY YOU?
  HAM. NAY THEN I HAUE AN EYE OF YOU: IF YOU LOUE ME
HOLD NOT OFF

   GUIL. MY LORD, WE WERE SENT FOR

   HAM. I WILL TELL YOU WHY; SO SHALL MY ANTICIPATION
PREUENT YOUR DISCOUERY OF YOUR SECRICIE TO THE KING AND
QUEENE: MOULT NO FEATHER, I HAUE OF LATE, BUT WHEREFORE
I KNOW NOT, LOST ALL MY MIRTH, FORGONE ALL CUSTOME OF EXERCISE;
AND INDEED, IT GOES SO HEAUENLY WITH MY DISPOSITION;
THAT THIS GOODLY FRAME THE EARTH, SEEMES TO ME A STERRILL
PROMONTORY; THIS MOST EXCELLENT CANOPY THE AYRE,
LOOK YOU, THIS BRAUE ORE-HANGING, THIS MAIESTICALL ROOFE,
FRETTED WITH GOLDEN FIRE: WHY, IT APPEARES NO OTHER THING
TO MEE, THEN A FOULE AND PESTILENT CONGREGATION OF VAPOURS.
WHAT A PIECE OF WORKE IS A MAN! HOW NOBLE IN
REASON? HOW INFINITE IN FACULTY? IN FORME AND MOUING
HOW EXPRESSE AND ADMIRABLE? IN ACTION, HOW LIKE AN ANGEL?
IN APPREHENSION, HOW LIKE A GOD? THE BEAUTY OF THE
WORLD, THE PARRAGON OF ANIMALS; AND YET TO ME, WHAT IS
THIS QUINTESSENCE OF DUST? MAN DELIGHTS NOT ME; NO,
NOR WOMAN NEITHER; THOUGH BY YOUR SMILING YOU SEEME
TO SAY SO

   ROSIN. MY LORD, THERE WAS NO SUCH STUFFE IN MY
THOUGHTS

   HAM. WHY DID YOU LAUGH, WHEN I SAID, MAN DELIGHTS
NOT ME?
  ROSIN. TO THINKE, MY LORD, IF YOU DELIGHT NOT IN MAN,
WHAT LENTON ENTERTAINMENT THE PLAYERS SHALL RECEIUE
FROM YOU: WEE COATED THEM ON THE WAY, AND HITHER ARE
THEY COMMING TO OFFER YOU SERUICE

   HAM. HE THAT PLAYES THE KING SHALL BE WELCOME; HIS
MAIESTY SHALL HAUE TRIBUTE OF MEE: THE ADUENTUROUS
KNIGHT SHAL VSE HIS FOYLE AND TARGET: THE LOUER SHALL
NOT SIGH GRATIS, THE HUMOROUS MAN SHALL END HIS PART IN
PEACE: THE CLOWNE SHALL MAKE THOSE LAUGH WHOSE LUNGS
ARE TICKLED A'TH' SERE: AND THE LADY SHALL SAY HER MINDE
FREELY; OR THE BLANKE VERSE SHALL HALT FOR'T: WHAT PLAYERS
ARE THEY?
  ROSIN. EUEN THOSE YOU WERE WONT TO TAKE DELIGHT IN
THE TRAGEDIANS OF THE CITY

   HAM. HOW CHANCES IT THEY TRAUAILE? THEIR RESIDENCE
BOTH IN REPUTATION AND PROFIT WAS BETTER BOTH
WAYES

   ROSIN. I THINKE THEIR INHIBITION COMES BY THE MEANES
OF THE LATE INNOUATION?
  HAM. DOE THEY HOLD THE SAME ESTIMATION THEY DID
WHEN I WAS IN THE CITY? ARE THEY SO FOLLOW'D?
  ROSIN. NO INDEED, THEY ARE NOT

   HAM. HOW COMES IT? DOE THEY GROW RUSTY?
  ROSIN. NAY, THEIR INDEAUOUR KEEPES IN THE WONTED
PACE; BUT THERE IS SIR AN AYRIE OF CHILDREN, LITTLE
YASES, THAT CRYE OUT ON THE TOP OF QUESTION; AND
ARE MOST TYRANNICALLY CLAP'T FOR'T: THESE ARE NOW THE
FASHION, AND SO BE-RATLED THE COMMON STAGES (SO THEY
CALL THEM) THAT MANY WEARING RAPIERS, ARE AFFRAIDE OF
GOOSE-QUILS, AND DARE SCARSE COME THITHER

   HAM. WHAT ARE THEY CHILDREN? WHO MAINTAINS 'EM?
HOW ARE THEY ESCORTED? WILL THEY PURSUE THE QUALITY NO
LONGER THEN THEY CAN SING? WILL THEY NOT SAY AFTERWARDS
IF THEY SHOULD GROW THEMSELUES TO COMMON PLAYERS (AS
IT IS MOST LIKE IF THEIR MEANES ARE NOT BETTER) THEIR WRITERS
DO THEM WRONG, TO MAKE THEM EXCLAIM AGAINST THEIR
OWNE SUCCESSION

   ROSIN. FAITH THERE HA'S BENE MUCH TO DO ON BOTH SIDES:
AND THE NATION HOLDS IT NO SINNE, TO TARRE THEM TO CONTROUERSIE.
THERE WAS FOR A WHILE, NO MONY BID FOR ARGUMENT,
VNLESSE THE POET AND THE PLAYER WENT TO CUFFES IN
THE QUESTION

   HAM. IS'T POSSIBLE?
  GUILD. OH THERE HA'S BEENE MUCH THROWING ABOUT OF
BRAINES

   HAM. DO THE BOYES CARRY IT AWAY?
  ROSIN. I THAT THEY DO MY LORD. HERCULES & HIS LOAD TOO

   HAM. IT IS NOT STRANGE: FOR MINE VNCKLE IS KING OF
DENMARKE, AND THOSE THAT WOULD MAKE MOWES AT HIM
WHILE MY FATHER LIUED; GIUE TWENTY, FORTY, AN HUNDRED
DUCATES A PEECE, FOR HIS PICTURE IN LITTLE. THERE IS SOMETHING
IN THIS MORE THEN NATURALL, IF PHILOSOPHIE COULD
FINDE IT OUT.

FLOURISH FOR THE PLAYERS.

  GUIL. THERE ARE THE PLAYERS

   HAM. GENTLEMEN, YOU ARE WELCOM TO ELSONOWER: YOUR

AND CEREMONY. LET ME COMPLY WITH YOU IN THE GARBE,
LEST MY EXTENT TO THE PLAYERS (WHICH I TELL YOU MUST SHEW
FAIRELY OUTWARD) SHOULD MORE APPEARE LIKE ENTERTAINMENT
THEN YOURS. YOU ARE WELCOME: BUT MY VNCKLE FATHER,

  POL. WELL BE WITH YOU GENTLEMEN

   POL. MY LORD, I HAUE NEWES TO TELL YOU

  POLON. IF YOU CALL ME IEPHTA MY LORD, I HAUE A DAUGHTER
THAT I LOUE PASSING WELL

   HAM. NAY THAT FOLLOWES NOT

   POLON. WHAT FOLLOWES THEN, MY LORD?
  HA. WHY, AS BY LOT, GOD WOT: AND THEN YOU KNOW, IT

BYRLADY YOUR LADISHIP IS NEERER HEAUEN THEN WHEN
I SAW YOU LAST, BY THE ALTITUDE OF A CHOPPINE. PRAY GOD

WITHIN THE RING. MASTERS, YOU ARE ALL WELCOME: WEE'L E'NE
TO'T LIKE FRENCH FAULCONERS, FLIE AT ANY THING WE SEE: WEE'L
HAUE A SPEECH STRAIGHT. COME GIUE VS A TAST OF YOUR QUALITY:
COME, A PASSIONATE SPEECH

   1.PLAY. WHAT SPEECH, MY LORD?
  HAM. I HEARD THEE SPEAK ME A SPEECH ONCE, BUT IT WAS
NEUER ACTED: OR IF IT WAS, NOT ABOUE ONCE, FOR THE PLAY I
REMEMBER PLEAS'D NOT THE MILLION, 'TWAS CAUIARIE TO THE
GENERALL: BUT IT WAS (AS I RECEIU'D IT, AND OTHERS, WHOSE
IUDGEMENT IN SUCH MATTERS, CRIED IN THE TOP OF MINE) AN
EXCELLENT PLAY; WELL DIGESTED IN THE SCOENES, SET DOWNE
WITH AS MUCH MODESTIE, AS CUNNING. I REMEMBER ONE SAID,
THERE WAS NO SALLETS IN THE LINES, TO MAKE THE MATTER SAUORY;
NOR NO MATTER IN THE PHRASE, THAT MIGHT INDITE THE
AUTHOR OF AFFECTATION, BUT CAL'D IT AN HONEST METHOD. ONE
CHEEFE SPEECH IN IT, I CHEEFELY LOU'D, 'TWAS AENEAS TALE
TO DIDO, AND THEREABOUT OF IT ESPECIALLY, WHERE HE SPEAKS
OF PRIAMS SLAUGHTER. IF IT LIUE IN YOUR MEMORY, BEGIN AT
THIS LINE, LET ME SEE, LET ME SEE: THE RUGGED PYRRHUS LIKE
TH'HYRCANIAN BEAST. IT IS NOT SO: IT BEGINS WITH PYRRHUS
THE RUGGED PYRRHUS, HE WHOSE SABLE ARMES
BLACKE AS HIS PURPOSE, DID THE NIGHT RESEMBLE
WHEN HE LAY COUCHED IN THE OMINOUS HORSE,
HATH NOW THIS DREAD AND BLACKE COMPLEXION SMEAR'D
WITH HERALDRY MORE DISMALL: HEAD TO FOOTE
NOW IS HE TO TAKE GEULLES, HORRIDLY TRICK'D
WITH BLOOD OF FATHERS, MOTHERS, DAUGHTERS, SONNES,
BAK'D AND IMPASTED WITH THE PARCHING STREETS,
THAT LEND A TYRANNOUS, AND DAMNED LIGHT
TO THEIR VILDE MURTHERS, ROASTED IN WRATH AND FIRE,
AND THUS O'RE-SIZED WITH COAGULATE GORE,
WITH EYES LIKE CARBUNCLES, THE HELLISH PYRRHUS
OLDE GRANDSIRE PRIAM SEEKES

   POL. FORE GOD, MY LORD, WELL SPOKEN, WITH GOOD ACCENT,
AND GOOD DISCRETION

   1.PLAYER. ANON HE FINDES HIM,
STRIKING TOO SHORT AT GREEKES. HIS ANTICKE SWORD,
REBELLIOUS TO HIS ARME, LYES WHERE IT FALLES
REPUGNANT TO COMMAND: VNEQUALL MATCH,
PYRRHUS AT PRIAM DRIUES, IN RAGE STRIKES WIDE:
BUT WITH THE WHIFFE AND WINDE OF HIS FELL SWORD,
TH' VNNERUED FATHER FALS. THEN SENSELESSE ILLIUM,
SEEMING TO FEELE HIS BLOW, WITH FLAMING TOP
STOOPES TO HIS BACE, AND WITH A HIDEOUS CRASH
TAKES PRISONER PYRRHUS EARE. FOR LOE, HIS SWORD
WHICH WAS DECLINING ON THE MILKIE HEAD
OF REUEREND PRIAM, SEEM'D I'TH' AYRE TO STICKE:
SO AS A PAINTED TYRANT PYRRHUS STOOD,
AND LIKE A NEWTRALL TO HIS WILL AND MATTER, DID NOTHING.
BUT AS WE OFTEN SEE AGAINST SOME STORME,
A SILENCE IN THE HEAUENS, THE RACKE STAND STILL,
THE BOLD WINDES SPEECHLESSE, AND THE ORBE BELOW
AS HUSH AS DEATH: ANON THE DREADFULL THUNDER
DOTH REND THE REGION. SO AFTER PYRRHUS PAUSE,
A ROWSED VENGEANCE SETS HIM NEW A-WORKE,
AND NEUER DID THE CYCLOPS HAMMERS FALL
ON MARS HIS ARMOURS, FORG'D FOR PROOFE ETERNE,
WITH LESSE REMORSE THEN PYRRHUS BLEEDING SWORD
NOW FALLES ON PRIAM.
OUT, OUT, THOU STRUMPET-FORTUNE, ALL YOU GODS,
IN GENERALL SYNOD TAKE AWAY HER POWER:
BREAKE ALL THE SPOKES AND FALLIES FROM HER WHEELE,
AND BOULE THE ROUND NAUE DOWNE THE HILL OF HEAUEN,
AS LOW AS TO THE FIENDS

   POL. THIS IS TOO LONG

   HAM. IT SHALL TO'TH BARBARS, WITH YOUR BEARD. PRYTHEE
SAY ON: HE'S FOR A IIGGE, OR A TALE OF BAUDRY, OR HEE
SLEEPES. SAY ON; COME TO HECUBA

   1.PLAY. BUT WHO, O WHO, HAD SEEN THE INOBLED QUEEN

   HAM. THE INOBLED QUEENE?
  POL. THAT'S GOOD: INOBLED QUEENE IS GOOD

   1.PLAY. RUN BARE-FOOT VP AND DOWNE,
THREATNING THE FLAME
WITH BISSON RHEUME: A CLOUT ABOUT THAT HEAD,
WHERE LATE THE DIADEM STOOD, AND FOR A ROBE
ABOUT HER LANKE AND ALL ORE-TEAMED LOINES,
A BLANKET IN TH' ALARUM OF FEARE CAUGHT VP.
WHO THIS HAD SEENE, WITH TONGUE IN VENOME STEEP'D,
'GAINST FORTUNES STATE, WOULD TREASON HAUE PRONOUNC'D?
BUT IF THE GODS THEMSELUES DID SEE HER THEN,
WHEN SHE SAW PYRRHUS MAKE MALICIOUS SPORT
IN MINCING WITH HIS SWORD HER HUSBANDS LIMBES,
THE INSTANT BURST OF CLAMOUR THAT SHE MADE
(VNLESSE THINGS MORTALL MOUE THEM NOT AT ALL)
WOULD HAUE MADE MILCHE THE BURNING EYES OF HEAUEN,
AND PASSION IN THE GODS

   POL. LOOKE WHERE HE HA'S NOT TURN'D HIS COLOUR, AND
HA'S TEARES IN'S EYES. PRAY YOU NO MORE

   HAM. 'TIS WELL, ILE HAUE THEE SPEAKE OUT THE REST,
SOONE. GOOD MY LORD, WILL YOU SEE THE PLAYERS WEL BESTOW'D.
DO YE HEARE, LET THEM BE WELL VS'D: FOR THEY ARE
THE ABSTRACTS AND BREEFE CHRONICLES OF THE TIME. AFTER
YOUR DEATH, YOU WERE BETTER HAUE A BAD EPITAPH, THEN
THEIR ILL REPORT WHILE YOU LIUED

   POL. MY LORD, I WILL VSE THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR DESART

   HAM. GODS BODYKINS MAN, BETTER. VSE EUERIE MAN
AFTER HIS DESART, AND WHO SHOULD SCAPE WHIPPING: VSE
THEM AFTER YOUR OWN HONOR AND DIGNITY. THE LESSE THEY
DESERUE, THE MORE MERIT IS IN YOUR BOUNTIE. TAKE THEM
IN

   POL. COME SIRS.

EXIT POLON.

  HAM. FOLLOW HIM FRIENDS: WEE'L HEARE A PLAY TO MORROW.
DOST THOU HEARE ME OLD FRIEND, CAN YOU PLAY THE
MURTHER OF GONZAGO?
  PLAY. I MY LORD

   HAM. WEE'L HA'T TO MORROW NIGHT. YOU COULD FOR A

I WOULD SET DOWNE, AND INSERT IN'T? COULD YE NOT?
  PLAY. I MY LORD

   HAM. VERY WELL. FOLLOW THAT LORD, AND LOOKE YOU
MOCK HIM NOT. MY GOOD FRIENDS, ILE LEAUE YOU TIL NIGHT
YOU ARE WELCOME TO ELSONOWER?
  ROSIN. GOOD MY LORD.

EXEUNT.

MANET HAMLET.

  HAM. I SO, GOD BUY'YE: NOW I AM ALONE.
OH WHAT A ROGUE AND PESANT SLAUE AM I?
IS IT NOT MONSTROUS THAT THIS PLAYER HEERE,
BUT IN A FIXION, IN A DREAME OF PASSION,
COULD FORCE HIS SOULE SO TO HIS WHOLE CONCEIT,
THAT FROM HER WORKING, ALL HIS VISAGE WARM'D;
TEARES IN HIS EYES, DISTRACTION IN'S ASPECT,
A BROKEN VOYCE, AND HIS WHOLE FUNCTION SUITING
WITH FORMES, TO HIS CONCEIT? AND ALL FOR NOTHING?
FOR HECUBA?
WHAT'S HECUBA TO HIM, OR HE TO HECUBA,
THAT HE SHOULD WEEPE FOR HER? WHAT WOULD HE DOE,
HAD HE THE MOTIUE AND THE CUE FOR PASSION
THAT I HAUE? HE WOULD DROWNE THE STAGE WITH TEARES,
AND CLEAUE THE GENERALL EARE WITH HORRID SPEECH:
MAKE MAD THE GUILTY, AND APALE THE FREE,
CONFOUND THE IGNORANT, AND AMAZE INDEED,
THE VERY FACULTY OF EYES AND EARES. YET I,
A DULL AND MUDDY-METLED RASCALL, PEAKE
LIKE IOHN A-DREAMES, VNPREGNANT OF MY CAUSE,
AND CAN SAY NOTHING: NO, NOT FOR A KING,
VPON WHOSE PROPERTY, AND MOST DEERE LIFE,
A DAMN'D DEFEATE WAS MADE. AM I A COWARD?
WHO CALLES ME VILLAINE? BREAKES MY PATE A-CROSSE?
PLUCKES OFF MY BEARD, AND BLOWES IT IN MY FACE?
TWEAKES ME BY'TH' NOSE? GIUES ME THE LYE I'TH' THROATE,
AS DEEPE AS TO THE LUNGS? WHO DOES ME THIS?
HA? WHY I SHOULD TAKE IT: FOR IT CANNOT BE,
BUT I AM PIGEON-LIUER'D, AND LACKE GALL
TO MAKE OPPRESSION BITTER, OR ERE THIS,
I SHOULD HAUE FATTED ALL THE REGION KITES
WITH THIS SLAUES OFFALL, BLOUDY: A BAWDY VILLAINE,
REMORSELESSE, TREACHEROUS, LETCHEROUS, KINDLES VILLAINE!
OH VENGEANCE!
WHO? WHAT AN ASSE AM I? I SURE, THIS IS MOST BRAUE,
THAT I, THE SONNE OF THE DEERE MURTHERED,
PROMPTED TO MY REUENGE BY HEAUEN, AND HELL,
MUST (LIKE A WHORE) VNPACKE MY HEART WITH WORDS,
AND FALL A CURSING LIKE A VERY DRAB.
A SCULLION? FYE VPON'T: FOH. ABOUT MY BRAINE.
I HAUE HEARD, THAT GUILTY CREATURES SITTING AT A PLAY,
HAUE BY THE VERY CUNNING OF THE SCOENE,
BENE STROOKE SO TO THE SOULE, THAT PRESENTLY
THEY HAUE PROCLAIM'D THEIR MALEFACTIONS.
FOR MURTHER, THOUGH IT HAUE NO TONGUE, WILL SPEAKE
WITH MOST MYRACULOUS ORGAN. ILE HAUE THESE PLAYERS,
PLAY SOMETHING LIKE THE MURDER OF MY FATHER,
BEFORE MINE VNKLE. ILE OBSERUE HIS LOOKES,
ILE RENT HIM TO THE QUICKE: IF HE BUT BLENCH
I KNOW MY COURSE. THE SPIRIT THAT I HAUE SEENE
MAY BE THE DIUELL, AND THE DIUEL HATH POWER
T' ASSUME A PLEASING SHAPE, YEA AND PERHAPS
OUT OF MY WEAKNESSE, AND MY MELANCHOLLY,
AS HE IS VERY POTENT WITH SUCH SPIRITS,
ABUSES ME TO DAMNE ME. ILE HAUE GROUNDS
MORE RELATIUE THEN THIS: THE PLAY'S THE THING,
WHEREIN ILE CATCH THE CONSCIENCE OF THE KING.

EXIT

ENTER KING, QUEENE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSINCRANCE,
GUILDENSTERN, AND
LORDS.

  KING. AND CAN YOU BY NO DRIFT OF CIRCUMSTANCE
GET FROM HIM WHY HE PUTS ON THIS CONFUSION:
GRATING SO HARSHLY ALL HIS DAYES OF QUIET
WITH TURBULENT AND DANGEROUS LUNACY

   ROSIN. HE DOES CONFESSE HE FEELES HIMSELFE DISTRACTED,
BUT FROM WHAT CAUSE HE WILL BY NO MEANES SPEAKE

   GUIL. NOR DO WE FINDE HIM FORWARD TO BE SOUNDED,
BUT WITH A CRAFTY MADNESSE KEEPES ALOOFE:
WHEN WE WOULD BRING HIM ON TO SOME CONFESSION
OF HIS TRUE STATE

   QU. DID HE RECEIUE YOU WELL?
  ROSIN. MOST LIKE A GENTLEMAN

   GUILD. BUT WITH MUCH FORCING OF HIS DISPOSITION

   ROSIN. NIGGARD OF QUESTION, BUT OF OUR DEMANDS
MOST FREE IN HIS REPLY

   QU. DID YOU ASSAY HIM TO ANY PASTIME?
  ROSIN. MADAM, IT SO FELL OUT, THAT CERTAINE PLAYERS
WE ORE-WROUGHT ON THE WAY: OF THESE WE TOLD HIM,
AND THERE DID SEEME IN HIM A KINDE OF IOY
TO HEARE OF IT: THEY ARE ABOUT THE COURT,
AND (AS I THINKE) THEY HAUE ALREADY ORDER
THIS NIGHT TO PLAY BEFORE HIM

   POL. 'TIS MOST TRUE:
AND HE BESEECH'D ME TO INTREATE YOUR MAIESTIES
TO HEARE, AND SEE THE MATTER

   KING. WITH ALL MY HEART, AND IT DOTH MUCH CONTENT ME
TO HEARE HIM SO INCLIN'D. GOOD GENTLEMEN,
GIUE HIM A FURTHER EDGE, AND DRIUE HIS PURPOSE ON
TO THESE DELIGHTS

   ROSIN. WE SHALL MY LORD.

EXEUNT.

  KING. SWEET GERTRUDE LEAUE VS TOO,
FOR WE HAUE CLOSELY SENT FOR HAMLET HITHER,
THAT HE, AS 'TWERE BY ACCIDENT, MAY THERE
AFFRONT OPHELIA. HER FATHER, AND MY SELFE (LAWFUL ESPIALS)
WILL SO BESTOW OUR SELUES, THAT SEEING VNSEENE
WE MAY OF THEIR ENCOUNTER FRANKELY IUDGE,
AND GATHER BY HIM, AS HE IS BEHAUED,
IF'T BE TH' AFFLICTION OF HIS LOUE, OR NO.
THAT THUS HE SUFFERS FOR

   QU. I SHALL OBEY YOU,
AND FOR YOUR PART OPHELIA, I DO WISH
THAT YOUR GOOD BEAUTIES BE THE HAPPY CAUSE
OF HAMLETS WILDENESSE: SO SHALL I HOPE YOUR VERTUES
WILL BRING HIM TO HIS WONTED WAY AGAINE,
TO BOTH YOUR HONORS

   OPHE. MADAM, I WISH IT MAY

   POL. OPHELIA, WALKE YOU HEERE. GRACIOUS SO PLEASE YE
WE WILL BESTOW OUR SELUES: READE ON THIS BOOKE,
THAT SHEW OF SUCH AN EXERCISE MAY COLOUR
YOUR LONELINESSE. WE ARE OFT TOO BLAME IN THIS,
'TIS TOO MUCH PROU'D, THAT WITH DEUOTIONS VISAGE,
AND PIOUS ACTION, WE DO SURGE O'RE
THE DIUELL HIMSELFE

   KING. OH 'TIS TRUE:
HOW SMART A LASH THAT SPEECH DOTH GIUE MY CONSCIENCE?
THE HARLOTS CHEEKE BEAUTIED WITH PLAIST'RING ART
IS NOT MORE VGLY TO THE THING THAT HELPES IT,
THEN IS MY DEEDE, TO MY MOST PAINTED WORD.
OH HEAUIE BURTHEN!
  POL. I HEARE HIM COMMING, LET'S WITHDRAW MY LORD.

EXEUNT.

ENTER HAMLET.

  HAM. TO BE, OR NOT TO BE, THAT IS THE QUESTION:
WHETHER 'TIS NOBLER IN THE MINDE TO SUFFER
THE SLINGS AND ARROWES OF OUTRAGIOUS FORTUNE,
OR TO TAKE ARMES AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLES,
AND BY OPPOSING END THEM: TO DYE, TO SLEEPE
NO MORE; AND BY A SLEEPE, TO SAY WE END
THE HEART-AKE, AND THE THOUSAND NATURALL SHOCKES
THAT FLESH IS HEYRE TOO? 'TIS A CONSUMMATION
DEUOUTLY TO BE WISH'D. TO DYE TO SLEEPE,
TO SLEEPE, PERCHANCE TO DREAME; I, THERE'S THE RUB,
FOR IN THAT SLEEPE OF DEATH, WHAT DREAMES MAY COME,
WHEN WE HAUE SHUFFEL'D OFF THIS MORTALL COILE,
MUST GIUE VS PAWSE. THERE'S THE RESPECT
THAT MAKES CALAMITY OF SO LONG LIFE:
FOR WHO WOULD BEARE THE WHIPS AND SCORNES OF TIME,
THE OPPRESSORS WRONG, THE POORE MANS CONTUMELY,
THE PANGS OF DISPRIZ'D LOUE, THE LAWES DELAY,
THE INSOLENCE OF OFFICE, AND THE SPURNES
THAT PATIENT MERIT OF THE VNWORTHY TAKES,
WHEN HE HIMSELFE MIGHT HIS QUIETUS MAKE
WITH A BARE BODKIN? WHO WOULD THESE FARDLES BEARE
TO GRUNT AND SWEAT VNDER A WEARY LIFE,
BUT THAT THE DREAD OF SOMETHING AFTER DEATH,
THE VNDISCOUERED COUNTREY, FROM WHOSE BORNE
NO TRAUELLER RETURNES, PUZELS THE WILL,
AND MAKES VS RATHER BEARE THOSE ILLES WE HAUE,
THEN FLYE TO OTHERS THAT WE KNOW NOT OF.
THUS CONSCIENCE DOES MAKE COWARDS OF VS ALL,
AND THUS THE NATIUE HEW OF RESOLUTION
IS SICKLIED O'RE, WITH THE PALE CAST OF THOUGHT,
AND ENTERPRIZES OF GREAT PITH AND MOMENT,
WITH THIS REGARD THEIR CURRANTS TURNE AWAY,
AND LOOSE THE NAME OF ACTION. SOFT YOU NOW,
THE FAIRE OPHELIA? NIMPH, IN THY ORIZONS
BE ALL MY SINNES REMEMBRED

   OPHE. GOOD MY LORD,
HOW DOES YOUR HONOR FOR THIS MANY A DAY?
  HAM. I HUMBLY THANKE YOU: WELL, WELL, WELL

   OPHE. MY LORD, I HAUE REMEMBRANCES OF YOURS,
THAT I HAUE LONGED LONG TO RE-DELIUER.
I PRAY YOU NOW, RECEIUE THEM

   HAM. NO, NO, I NEUER GAUE YOU OUGHT

   OPHE. MY HONOR'D LORD, I KNOW RIGHT WELL YOU DID,
AND WITH THEM WORDS OF SO SWEET BREATH COMPOS'D,
AS MADE THE THINGS MORE RICH, THEN PERFUME LEFT:
TAKE THESE AGAINE, FOR TO THE NOBLE MINDE
RICH GIFTS WAX POORE, WHEN GIUERS PROUE VNKINDE.
THERE MY LORD

   HAM. HA, HA: ARE YOU HONEST?
  OPHE. MY LORD

   HAM. ARE YOU FAIRE?
  OPHE. WHAT MEANES YOUR LORDSHIP?
  HAM. THAT IF YOU BE HONEST AND FAIRE, YOUR HONESTY
SHOULD ADMIT NO DISCOURSE TO YOUR BEAUTIE

   OPHE. COULD BEAUTIE MY LORD, HAUE BETTER COMERCE
THEN YOUR HONESTIE?
  HAM. I TRULIE: FOR THE POWER OF BEAUTIE, WILL SOONER
TRANSFORME HONESTIE FROM WHAT IS, TO A BAWD, THEN THE
FORCE OF HONESTIE CAN TRANSLATE BEAUTIE INTO HIS LIKENESSE.
THIS WAS SOMETIME A PARADOX, BUT NOW THE TIME GIUES IT
PROOFE. I DID LOUE YOU ONCE

   OPHE. INDEED MY LORD, YOU MADE ME BELEEUE SO

   HAM. YOU SHOULD NOT HAUE BELEEUED ME. FOR VERTUE
CANNOT SO INNOCCULATE OUR OLD STOCKE, BUT WE SHALL RELLISH
OF IT. I LOUED YOU NOT

   OPHE. I WAS THE MORE DECEIUED

   HAM. GET THEE TO A NUNNERIE. WHY WOULD'ST THOU
BE A BREEDER OF SINNERS? I AM MY SELFE INDIFFERENT HONEST,
BUT YET I COULD ACCUSE ME OF SUCH THINGS, THAT IT WERE BETTER
MY MOTHER HAD NOT BORNE ME. I AM VERY PROWD, REUENGEFULL,
AMBITIOUS, WITH MORE OFFENCES AT MY BECKE,
THEN I HAUE THOUGHTS TO PUT THEM IN IMAGINATION, TO GIUE
THEM SHAPE, OR TIME TO ACTE THEM IN. WHAT SHOULD SUCH
FELLOWES AS I DO, CRAWLING BETWEENE HEAUEN AND EARTH.
WE ARE ARRANT KNAUES ALL, BELEEUE NONE OF VS. GOE THY
WAYES TO A NUNNERY. WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?
  OPHE. AT HOME, MY LORD

   HAM. LET THE DOORES BE SHUT VPON HIM, THAT HE MAY
PLAY THE FOOLE NO WAY, BUT IN'S OWNE HOUSE. FAREWELL

   OPHE. O HELPE HIM, YOU SWEET HEAUENS

   HAM. IF THOU DOEST MARRY, ILE GIUE THEE THIS PLAGUE
FOR THY DOWRIE. BE THOU AS CHAST AS ICE, AS PURE AS SNOW,
THOU SHALT NOT ESCAPE CALUMNY. GET THEE TO A NUNNERY.
GO, FAREWELL. OR IF THOU WILT NEEDS MARRY, MARRY A FOOL:
FOR WISE MEN KNOW WELL ENOUGH, WHAT MONSTERS YOU
MAKE OF THEM. TO A NUNNERY GO, AND QUICKLY TOO. FARWELL

   OPHE. O HEAUENLY POWERS, RESTORE HIM

   HAM. I HAUE HEARD OF YOUR PRATLINGS TOO WEL ENOUGH.
GOD HAS GIUEN YOU ONE PACE, AND YOU MAKE YOUR SELFE ANOTHER:
YOU GIDGE, YOU AMBLE, AND YOU LISPE, AND NICKNAME
GODS CREATURES, AND MAKE YOUR WANTONNESSE, YOUR IGNORANCE.
GO TOO, ILE NO MORE ON'T, IT HATH MADE ME MAD.
I SAY, WE WILL HAUE NO MORE MARRIAGES. THOSE THAT ARE
MARRIED ALREADY, ALL BUT ONE SHALL LIUE, THE REST SHALL KEEP
AS THEY ARE. TO A NUNNERY, GO.

EXIT HAMLET.

  OPHE. O WHAT A NOBLE MINDE IS HEERE O'RE-THROWNE?
THE COURTIERS, SOLDIERS, SCHOLLERS: EYE, TONGUE, SWORD,
TH' EXPECTANSIE AND ROSE OF THE FAIRE STATE,
THE GLASSE OF FASHION, AND THE MOULD OF FORME,
TH' OBSERU'D OF ALL OBSERUERS, QUITE, QUITE DOWNE.
HAUE I OF LADIES MOST DEIECT AND WRETCHED,
THAT SUCK'D THE HONIE OF HIS MUSICKE VOWES:
NOW SEE THAT NOBLE, AND MOST SOUERAIGNE REASON,
LIKE SWEET BELS IANGLED OUT OF TUNE, AND HARSH,
THAT VNMATCH'D FORME AND FEATURE OF BLOWNE YOUTH,
BLASTED WITH EXTASIE. OH WOE IS ME,
T'HAUE SEENE WHAT I HAUE SEENE: SEE WHAT I SEE.
ENTER KING, AND POLONIUS.

  KING. LOUE? HIS AFFECTIONS DO NOT THAT WAY TEND,
NOR WHAT HE SPAKE, THOUGH IT LACK'D FORME A LITTLE,
WAS NOT LIKE MADNESSE. THERE'S SOMETHING IN HIS SOULE?
O'RE WHICH HIS MELANCHOLLY SITS ON BROOD,
AND I DO DOUBT THE HATCH, AND THE DISCLOSE
WILL BE SOME DANGER, WHICH TO PREUENT
I HAUE IN QUICKE DETERMINATION
THUS SET IT DOWNE. HE SHALL WITH SPEED TO ENGLAND
FOR THE DEMAND OF OUR NEGLECTED TRIBUTE:
HAPLY THE SEAS AND COUNTRIES DIFFERENT
WITH VARIABLE OBIECTS, SHALL EXPELL
THIS SOMETHING SETLED MATTER IN HIS HEART:
WHEREON HIS BRAINES STILL BEATING, PUTS HIM THUS
FROM FASHION OF HIMSELFE. WHAT THINKE YOU ON'T?
  POL. IT SHALL DO WELL. BUT YET DO I BELEEUE
THE ORIGIN AND COMMENCEMENT OF THIS GREEFE
SPRUNG FROM NEGLECTED LOUE. HOW NOW OPHELIA?
YOU NEEDE NOT TELL VS, WHAT LORD HAMLET SAIDE,
WE HEARD IT ALL. MY LORD, DO AS YOU PLEASE,
BUT IF YOU HOLD IT FIT AFTER THE PLAY,
LET HIS QUEENE MOTHER ALL ALONE INTREAT HIM
TO SHEW HIS GREEFES: LET HER BE ROUND WITH HIM,
AND ILE BE PLAC'D SO, PLEASE YOU IN THE EARE
OF ALL THEIR CONFERENCE. IF SHE FINDE HIM NOT,
TO ENGLAND SEND HIM: OR CONFINE HIM WHERE
YOUR WISEDOME BEST SHALL THINKE

   KING. IT SHALL BE SO:
MADNESSE IN GREAT ONES, MUST NOT VNWATCH'D GO.

EXEUNT.

ENTER HAMLET, AND TWO OR THREE OF THE PLAYERS.

  HAM. SPEAKE THE SPEECH I PRAY YOU, AS I PRONOUNC'D
IT TO YOU TRIPPINGLY ON THE TONGUE: BUT IF YOU MOUTH IT,
AS MANY OF YOUR PLAYERS DO, I HAD AS LIUE THE TOWN-CRYER
HAD SPOKE MY LINES: NOR DO NOT SAW THE AYRE TOO MUCH
YOUR HAND THUS, BUT VSE ALL GENTLY; FOR IN THE VERIE TORRENT,
TEMPEST, AND (AS I SAY) THE WHIRLE-WINDE OF
PASSION, YOU MUST ACQUIRE AND BEGET A TEMPERANCE THAT
MAY GIUE IT SMOOTHNESSE. O IT OFFENDS MEE TO THE SOULE,
TO SEE A ROBUSTIOUS PERY-WIG-PATED FELLOW, TEARE A PASSION
TO TATTERS, TO VERIE RAGGES, TO SPLIT THE EARES OF THE
GROUNDLINGS: WHO (FOR THE MOST PART) ARE CAPEABLE OF
NOTHING, BUT INEXPLICABLE DUMBE SHEWES, & NOISE: I COULD
HAUE SUCH A FELLOW WHIPT FOR O'RE-DOING TERMAGANT: IT
OUTHEROD'S HEROD. PRAY YOU AUOID IT

   PLAYER. I WARRANT YOUR HONOR

   HAM. BE NOT TOO TAME NEYTHER: BUT LET YOUR OWNE
DISCRETION BE YOUR TUTOR. SUTE THE ACTION TO THE WORD,
THE WORD TO THE ACTION, WITH THIS SPECIALL OBSERUANCE:
THAT YOU ORE-STOP NOT THE MODESTIE OF NATURE; FOR ANY
THING SO OUER-DONE, IS FRO[M] THE PURPOSE OF PLAYING, WHOSE
END BOTH AT THE FIRST AND NOW, WAS AND IS, TO HOLD AS 'TWER
THE MIRROUR VP TO NATURE; TO SHEW VERTUE HER OWNE
FEATURE, SCORNE HER OWNE IMAGE, AND THE VERIE AGE AND
BODIE OF THE TIME, HIS FORME AND PRESSURE. NOW, THIS
OUER-DONE, OR COME TARDIE OFF, THOUGH IT MAKE THE VNSKILFULL
LAUGH, CANNOT BUT MAKE THE IUDICIOUS GREEUE; THE
CENSURE OF THE WHICH ONE, MUST IN YOUR ALLOWANCE O'REWAY
A WHOLE THEATER OF OTHERS. OH, THERE BEE PLAYERS
THAT I HAUE SEENE PLAY, AND HEARD OTHERS PRAISE, AND THAT
HIGHLY (NOT TO SPEAKE IT PROPHANELY) THAT NEYTHER HAUING
THE ACCENT OF CHRISTIANS, NOR THE GATE OF CHRISTIAN, PAGAN,
OR NORMAN, HAUE SO STRUTTED AND BELLOWED, THAT I HAUE
THOUGHT SOME OF NATURES IOUERNEY-MEN HAD MADE MEN,
AND NOT MADE THEM WELL, THEY IMITATED HUMANITY SO ABHOMINABLY

   PLAY. I HOPE WE HAUE REFORM'D THAT INDIFFERENTLY WITH
VS, SIR

   HAM. O REFORME IT ALTOGETHER. AND LET THOSE THAT
PLAY YOUR CLOWNES, SPEAKE NO MORE THEN IS SET DOWNE FOR
THEM. FOR THERE BE OF THEM, THAT WILL THEMSELUES LAUGH,
TO SET ON SOME QUANTITIE OF BARREN SPECTATORS TO LAUGH
TOO, THOUGH IN THE MEANE TIME, SOME NECESSARY QUESTION
OF THE PLAY BE THEN TO BE CONSIDERED: THAT'S VILLANOUS, &
SHEWES A MOST PITTIFULL AMBITION IN THE FOOLE THAT VSES
IT. GO MAKE YOU READIE.

EXIT PLAYERS.

FOR WHAT ADUANCEMENT MAY I HOPE FROM THEE,
THAT NO REUENNEW HAST, BUT THY GOOD SPIRITS
TO FEED & CLOATH THEE. WHY SHOLD THE POOR BE FLATTER'D?
NO, LET THE CANDIED TONGUE, LIKE ABSURD POMPE,
AND CROOKE THE PREGNANT HINDGES OF THE KNEE,
WHERE THRIFT MAY FOLLOW FAINING? DOST THOU HEARE,
SINCE MY DEERE SOULE WAS MISTRIS OF MY CHOYSE,
AND COULD OF MEN DISTINGUISH, HER ELECTION
HATH SEAL'D THEE FOR HER SELFE. FOR THOU HAST BENE
AS ONE IN SUFFERING ALL, THAT SUFFERS NOTHING.
A MAN THAT FORTUNES BUFFETS, AND REWARDS
HATH 'TANE WITH EQUALL THANKES. AND BLEST ARE THOSE,
WHOSE BLOOD AND IUDGEMENT ARE SO WELL CO-MINGLED,
THAT THEY ARE NOT A PIPE FOR FORTUNES FINGER.
TO SOUND WHAT STOP SHE PLEASE. GIUE ME THAT MAN,
THAT IS NOT PASSIONS SLAUE, AND I WILL WEARE HIM
IN MY HEARTS CORE. I, IN MY HEART OF HEART,

  OPHE. I MY LORD

   HAM. OH GOD, YOUR ONELY IIGGE-MAKER: WHAT SHOULD

MY MOTHER LOOKES, AND MY FATHER DYED WITHIN'S TWO
HOURES

   OPHE. NAY, 'TIS TWICE TWO MONETHS, MY LORD

   HAM. SO LONG? NAY THEN LET THE DIUEL WEARE BLACKE,
FOR ILE HAUE A SUITE OF SABLES. OH HEAUENS! DYE TWO MONETHS
AGO, AND NOT FORGOTTEN YET? THEN THERE'S HOPE, A
GREAT MANS MEMORIE, MAY OUT-LIUE HIS LIFE HALFE A YEARE:
BUT BYRLADY HE MUST BUILDE CHURCHES THEN: OR ELSE SHALL

EPITAPH IS, FOR O, FOR O, THE HOBY-HORSE IS FORGOT.

HOBOYES PLAY. THE DUMBE SHEW ENTERS.

ENTER A KING AND QUEENE, VERY LOUINGLY; THE QUEENE EMBRACING
HIM. SHE
KNEELES, AND MAKES SHEW OF PROTESTATION VNTO HIM. HE TAKES HER
VP, AND
DECLINES HIS HEAD VPON HER NECK. LAYES HIM DOWNE VPON A BANKE
OF FLOWERS.
SHE SEEING HIM A-SLEEPE, LEAUES HIM. ANON COMES IN A FELLOW,
TAKES OFF HIS
CROWNE, KISSES IT, AND POWRES POYSON IN THE KINGS EARES, AND
EXITS. THE
QUEENE RETURNES, FINDES THE KING DEAD, AND MAKES PASSIONATE
ACTION. THE
POYSONER, WITH SOME TWO OR THREE MUTES COMES IN AGAINE, SEEMING
TO LAMENT
WITH HER. THE DEAD BODY IS CARRIED AWAY: THE POYSONER WOOES THE
QUEENE WITH
GIFTS, SHE SEEMES LOATH AND VNWILLING AWHILE, BUT IN THE END,
ACCEPTS HIS
LOUE.

EXEUNT.

  OPHE. WHAT MEANES THIS, MY LORD?
  HAM. MARRY THIS IS MICHING MALICHO, THAT MEANES
MISCHEEFE

   OPHE. BELIKE THIS SHEW IMPORTS THE ARGUMENT OF THE
PLAY?
  HAM. WE SHALL KNOW BY THESE FELLOWES: THE PLAYERS
CANNOT KEEPE COUNSELL, THEY'L TELL ALL

   OPHE. WILL THEY TELL VS WHAT THIS SHEW MEANT?
  HAM. I, OR ANY SHEW THAT YOU'L SHEW HIM. BEE NOT
YOU ASHAM'D TO SHEW, HEE'L NOT SHAME TO TELL YOU WHAT IT
MEANES

   OPHE. YOU ARE NAUGHT, YOU ARE NAUGHT, ILE MARKE THE
PLAY.
ENTER PROLOGUE.

FOR VS, AND FOR OUR TRAGEDIE,
HEERE STOOPING TO YOUR CLEMENCIE:
WE BEGGE YOUR HEARING PATIENTLIE

   HAM. IS THIS A PROLOGUE, OR THE POESIE OF A RING?
  OPHE. 'TIS BRIEFE MY LORD

   HAM. AS WOMANS LOUE.
ENTER KING AND HIS QUEENE.

  KING. FULL THIRTIE TIMES HATH PHOEBUS CART GON ROUND,
NEPTUNES SALT WASH, AND TELLUS ORBED GROUND:
AND THIRTIE DOZEN MOONES WITH BORROWED SHEENE,
ABOUT THE WORLD HAUE TIMES TWELUE THIRTIES BEENE,
SINCE LOUE OUR HEARTS, AND HYMEN DID OUR HANDS
VNITE COMUTUALL, IN MOST SACRED BANDS

   BAP. SO MANY IOURNIES MAY THE SUNNE AND MOONE
MAKE VS AGAINE COUNT O'RE, ERE LOUE BE DONE.
BUT WOE IS ME, YOU ARE SO SICKE OF LATE,
SO FARRE FROM CHEERE, AND FROM YOUR FORMER STATE,
THAT I DISTRUST YOU: YET THOUGH I DISTRUST,
DISCOMFORT YOU (MY LORD) IT NOTHING MUST:
FOR WOMENS FEARE AND LOUE, HOLDS QUANTITIE,
IN NEITHER OUGHT, OR IN EXTREMITY:
NOW WHAT MY LOUE IS, PROOFE HATH MADE YOU KNOW,
AND AS MY LOUE IS SIZ'D, MY FEARE IS SO

   KING. FAITH I MUST LEAUE THEE LOUE, AND SHORTLY TOO:
MY OPERANT POWERS MY FUNCTIONS LEAUE TO DO:
AND THOU SHALT LIUE IN THIS FAIRE WORLD BEHINDE,
HONOUR'D, BELOU'D, AND HAPLY, ONE AS KINDE.
FOR HUSBAND SHALT THOU-
  BAP. OH CONFOUND THE REST:
SUCH LOUE, MUST NEEDS BE TREASON IN MY BREST:
IN SECOND HUSBAND, LET ME BE ACCURST,
NONE WED THE SECOND, BUT WHO KILL'D THE FIRST

   HAM. WORMWOOD, WORMWOOD

   BAPT. THE INSTANCES THAT SECOND MARRIAGE MOUE,
ARE BASE RESPECTS OF THRIFT, BUT NONE OF LOUE.
A SECOND TIME, I KILL MY HUSBAND DEAD,
WHEN SECOND HUSBAND KISSES ME IN BED

   KING. I DO BELEEUE YOU. THINK WHAT NOW YOU SPEAK:
BUT WHAT WE DO DETERMINE, OFT WE BREAKE:
PURPOSE IS BUT THE SLAUE TO MEMORIE,
OF VIOLENT BIRTH, BUT POORE VALIDITIE:
WHICH NOW LIKE FRUITE VNRIPE STICKES ON THE TREE,
BUT FALL VNSHAKEN, WHEN THEY MELLOW BEE.
MOST NECESSARY 'TIS, THAT WE FORGET
TO PAY OUR SELUES, WHAT TO OUR SELUES IS DEBT:
WHAT TO OUR SELUES IN PASSION WE PROPOSE,
THE PASSION ENDING, DOTH THE PURPOSE LOSE.
THE VIOLENCE OF OTHER GREEFE OR IOY,
THEIR OWNE ENNACTORS WITH THEMSELUES DESTROY:
WHERE IOY MOST REUELS, GREEFE DOTH MOST LAMENT;
GREEFE IOYES, IOY GREEUES ON SLENDER ACCIDENT.
THIS WORLD IS NOT FOR AYE, NOR 'TIS NOT STRANGE
THAT EUEN OUR LOUES SHOULD WITH OUR FORTUNES CHANGE.
FOR 'TIS A QUESTION LEFT VS YET TO PROUE,
WHETHER LOUE LEAD FORTUNE, OR ELSE FORTUNE LOUE.
THE GREAT MAN DOWNE, YOU MARKE HIS FAUOURITES FLIES,
THE POORE ADUANC'D, MAKES FRIENDS OF ENEMIES:
AND HITHERTO DOTH LOUE ON FORTUNE TEND,
FOR WHO NOT NEEDS, SHALL NEUER LACKE A FREND:
AND WHO IN WANT A HOLLOW FRIEND DOTH TRY,
DIRECTLY SEASONS HIM HIS ENEMIE.
BUT ORDERLY TO END, WHERE I BEGUN,
OUR WILLES AND FATES DO SO CONTRARY RUN,
THAT OUR DEUICES STILL ARE OUERTHROWNE,
OUR THOUGHTS ARE OURS, THEIR ENDS NONE OF OUR OWNE.
SO THINKE THOU WILT NO SECOND HUSBAND WED.
BUT DIE THY THOUGHTS, WHEN THY FIRST LORD IS DEAD

   BAP. NOR EARTH TO GIUE ME FOOD, NOR HEAUEN LIGHT,
SPORT AND REPOSE LOCKE FROM ME DAY AND NIGHT:
EACH OPPOSITE THAT BLANKES THE FACE OF IOY,
MEET WHAT I WOULD HAUE WELL, AND IT DESTROY:
BOTH HEERE, AND HENCE, PURSUE ME LASTING STRIFE,
IF ONCE A WIDDOW, EUER I BE WIFE

   HAM. IF SHE SHOULD BREAKE IT NOW

   KING. 'TIS DEEPELY SWORNE:
SWEET, LEAUE ME HEERE A WHILE,
MY SPIRITS GROW DULL, AND FAINE I WOULD BEGUILE
THE TEDIOUS DAY WITH SLEEPE

   QU. SLEEPE ROCKE THY BRAINE,

SLEEPES

AND NEUER COME MISCHANCE BETWEENE VS TWAINE.

EXIT

  HAM. MADAM, HOW LIKE YOU THIS PLAY?
  QU. THE LADY PROTESTS TO MUCH ME THINKES

   HAM. OH BUT SHEE'L KEEPE HER WORD

   KING. HAUE YOU HEARD THE ARGUMENT, IS THERE NO OFFENCE

  HAM. NO, NO, THEY DO BUT IEST, POYSON IN IEST, NO OFFENCE

   KING. WHAT DO YOU CALL THE PLAY?
  HAM. THE MOUSE-TRAP: MARRY HOW? TROPICALLY:
THIS PLAY IS THE IMAGE OF A MURDER DONE IN VIENNA: GONZAGO
IS THE DUKES NAME, HIS WIFE BAPTISTA: YOU SHALL SEE
ANON: 'TIS A KNAUISH PEECE OF WORKE: BUT WHAT O'THAT?
YOUR MAIESTIE, AND WEE THAT HAUE FREE SOULES, IT TOUCHES

ENTER LUCIANUS.

THIS IS ONE LUCIANUS NEPHEW TO THE KING

   OPHE. YOU ARE A GOOD CHORUS, MY LORD

   HAM. I COULD INTERPRET BETWEENE YOU AND YOUR LOUE:
IF I COULD SEE THE PUPPETS DALLYING

   OPHE. YOU ARE KEENE MY LORD, YOU ARE KEENE

   HAM. IT WOULD COST YOU A GROANING, TO TAKE OFF MY
EDGE

   OPHE. STILL BETTER AND WORSE

   HAM. SO YOU MISTAKE HUSBANDS.
BEGIN MURDERER. POX, LEAUE THY DAMNABLE FACES, AND
BEGIN. COME, THE CROAKING RAUEN DOTH BELLOW FOR REUENGE

WITH HECATS BAN, THRICE BLASTED, THRICE INFECTED,
THY NATURALL MAGICKE, AND DIRE PROPERTIE,

POWRES THE POYSON IN HIS EARES.

  HAM. HE POYSONS HIM I'TH' GARDEN FOR'S ESTATE: HIS
NAME'S GONZAGO: THE STORY IS EXTANT AND WRIT IN CHOYCE
ITALIAN. YOU SHALL SEE ANON HOW THE MURTHERER GETS THE

HORATIO, WHEN THOU SHALT HAUE OUERLOOK'D THIS, GIUE THESE
FELLOWES SOME MEANES TO THE KING: THEY HAUE LETTERS
FOR HIM. ERE WE WERE TWO DAYES OLD AT SEA, A PYRATE OF VERY
WARLICKE APPOINTMENT GAUE VS CHACE. FINDING OUR SELUES TOO
SLOW OF SAILE, WE PUT ON A COMPELLED VALOUR. IN THE GRAPPLE, I
BOORDED THEM: ON THE INSTANT THEY GOT CLEARE OF OUR SHIPPE, SO
I ALONE BECAME THEIR PRISONER. THEY HAUE DEALT WITH MEE, LIKE
THEEUES OF MERCY, BUT THEY KNEW WHAT THEY DID. I AM TO DOE
A GOOD TURNE FOR THEM. LET THE KING HAUE THE LETTERS I HAUE
SENT, AND REPAIRE THOU TO ME WITH AS MUCH HAST AS THOU WOULDEST
FLYE DEATH. I HAUE WORDS TO SPEAKE IN YOUR EARE, WILL MAKE THEE
DUMBE, YET ARE THEY MUCH TOO LIGHT FOR THE BORE OF THE MATTER.
THESE GOOD FELLOWES WILL BRING THEE WHERE I AM. ROSINCRANCE

LIUES ALMOST BY HIS LOOKES: AND FOR MY SELFE,
MY VERTUE OR MY PLAGUE, BE IT EITHER WHICH,
SHE'S SO CONIUNCTIUE TO MY LIFE, AND SOULE;
THAT AS THE STARRE MOUES NOT BUT IN HIS SPHERE,
I COULD NOT BUT BY HER. THE OTHER MOTIUE,
WHY TO A PUBLIKE COUNT I MIGHT NOT GO,
IS THE GREAT LOUE THE GENERALL GENDER BEARE HIM,
WHO DIPPING ALL HIS FAULTS IN THEIR AFFECTION,
WOULD LIKE THE SPRING THAT TURNETH WOOD TO STONE,
CONUERT HIS GYUES TO GRACES. SO THAT MY ARROWES
TOO SLIGHTLY TIMBRED FOR SO LOUD A WINDE,
WOULD HAUE REUERTED TO MY BOW AGAINE,
AND NOT WHERE I HAD ARM'D THEM

   LAER. AND SO HAUE I A NOBLE FATHER LOST,
A SISTER DRIUEN INTO DESPERATE TEARMES,
WHO WAS (IF PRAISES MAY GO BACKE AGAINE)
STOOD CHALLENGER ON MOUNT OF ALL THE AGE
FOR HER PERFECTIONS. BUT MY REUENGE WILL COME

   KING. BREAKE NOT YOUR SLEEPES FOR THAT,
YOU MUST NOT THINKE
THAT WE ARE MADE OF STUFFE, SO FLAT, AND DULL,
THAT WE CAN LET OUR BEARD BE SHOOKE WITH DANGER,
AND THINKE IT PASTIME. YOU SHORTLY SHALL HEARE MORE,

AND THAT I HOPE WILL TEACH YOU TO IMAGINE-
ENTER A MESSENGER.

TO AN EXPLOYT NOW RIPE IN MY DEUICE,
VNDER THE WHICH HE SHALL NOT CHOOSE BUT FALL;
AND FOR HIS DEATH NO WINDE OF BLAME SHALL BREATH,
BUT EUEN HIS MOTHER SHALL VNCHARGE THE PRACTICE,
AND CALL IT ACCIDENT: SOME TWO MONTHES HENCE
HERE WAS A GENTLEMAN OF NORMANDY,
I'UE SEENE MY SELFE, AND SERU'D AGAINST THE FRENCH,
AND THEY RAN WELL ON HORSEBACKE; BUT THIS GALLANT
HAD WITCHCRAFT IN'T; HE GREW INTO HIS SEAT,
AND TO SUCH WONDROUS DOING BROUGHT HIS HORSE,
AS HAD HE BEENE ENCORPS'T AND DEMY-NATUR'D
WITH THE BRAUE BEAST, SO FARRE HE PAST MY THOUGHT,
THAT I IN FORGERY OF SHAPES AND TRICKES,

   LAER. WHY OUT OF THIS, MY LORD?
  KIN. LAERTES WAS YOUR FATHER DEARE TO YOU?
OR ARE YOU LIKE THE PAINTING OF A SORROW,
A FACE WITHOUT A HEART?
  LAER. WHY ASKE YOU THIS?
  KIN. NOT THAT I THINKE YOU DID NOT LOUE YOUR FATHER,
BUT THAT I KNOW LOUE IS BEGUN BY TIME:

TO SHOW YOUR SELFE YOUR FATHERS SONNE INDEED,
MORE THEN IN WORDS?
  LAER. TO CUT HIS THROAT I'TH' CHURCH

   KIN. NO PLACE INDEED SHOULD MURDER SANCTURIZE;

WILL YOU DOE THIS, KEEPE CLOSE WITHIN YOUR CHAMBER,
HAMLET RETURN'D, SHALL KNOW YOU ARE COME HOME:
WEE'L PUT ON THOSE SHALL PRAISE YOUR EXCELLENCE,
AND SET A DOUBLE VARNISH ON THE FAME
THE FRENCHMAN GAUE YOU, BRING YOU IN FINE TOGETHER,
AND WAGER ON YOUR HEADS, HE BEING REMISSE,
MOST GENEROUS, AND FREE FROM ALL CONTRIUING,
WILL NOT PERUSE THE FOILES? SO THAT WITH EASE,
OR WITH A LITTLE SHUFFLING, YOU MAY CHOOSE
A SWORD VNBAITED, AND IN A PASSE OF PRACTICE,
REQUIT HIM FOR YOUR FATHER

   LAER. I WILL DOO'T.
AND FOR THAT PURPOSE ILE ANNOINT MY SWORD:
I BOUGHT AN VNCTION OF A MOUNTEBANKE
SO MORTALL, I BUT DIPT A KNIFE IN IT,
WHERE IT DRAWES BLOOD, NO CATAPLASME SO RARE,
COLLECTED FROM ALL SIMPLES THAT HAUE VERTUE
VNDER THE MOONE, CAN SAUE THE THING FROM DEATH,
THAT IS BUT SCRATCHT WITHALL: ILE TOUCH MY POINT,
WITH THIS CONTAGION, THAT IF I GALL HIM SLIGHTLY,
IT MAY BE DEATH

   KIN. LET'S FURTHER THINKE OF THIS,
WEIGH WHAT CONUENIENCE BOTH OF TIME AND MEANES
MAY FIT VS TO OUR SHAPE, IF THIS SHOULD FAILE;
AND THAT OUR DRIFT LOOKE THROUGH OUR BAD PERFORMANCE,
'TWERE BETTER NOT ASSAID; THEREFORE THIS PROIECT
SHOULD HAUE A BACKE OR SECOND, THAT MIGHT HOLD,
IF THIS SHOULD BLAST IN PROOFE: SOFT, LET ME SEE
